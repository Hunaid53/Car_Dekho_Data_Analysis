# Car_Dekho_Data_Analysis
<h2>About the Project</h2>
<h3>This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing a dataset of vehicle sales. The scripts use the pandas library to perform various analyses on the dataset, including:</h3>
1. Counting the number of different vehicles in the dataset.<br>
2. Finding the most and least sold vehicles.<br>
3. Calculating the depreciation of each vehicle and identifying the vehicles with the most and least depreciation.<br>
4. Identifying the brands of vehicles that are less affected by cost depreciation.<br>
5. Filtering the dataset to only include vehicles manufactured after a certain year.<br>
6. Sorting the dataset by the ‘Year’ column to find the oldest and newest cars sold.<br>
7. Calculating the difference between the selling price and the present price of each vehicle to identify good deals.<br>
8. The dataset used in these scripts includes the following columns: Car_Name, Year, Selling_Price, Present_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission, Owner.<br>
